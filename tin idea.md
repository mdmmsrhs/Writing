# Tracing the Genetic and Epigenetic Impact of Environmental Metal Peaks at Technological Transitions in Plants #

## The Copper and Bronze Age ##

### Metallurgy ###
- Rise of copper use
	- mining
		- spoil
		- soil pollution
		- groundwater pollution
		
	- Refining and Smelting
		- Crucible design
		- Trace contaminants eg. Bismuth
		- atmospheric pollution (ombrotrophic bogs)

	
	- Rise of copper hardening
		- arsenical hardening
		- stannous hardening
		- other hardening agents eg. antimony
		
'Tin bronze is thought to be superior to copper for a number of reasons: among them its lower casting temperature, its better casting properties, its colour (see above for the early use of tin bronze for prestigious objects in the Near East) and its higher hardness both in the as-cast state and after working.'

'fahlore copper (is) rich in a number of trace elements such as arsenic, antimony, silver and nickel, derived from sulphidic copper ores, although it was widely used during the Early Bronze Age from the western Alps to the Baltic Sea as well as into the Carpathian Basin to the east. Best known as ‘Singen’ copper after its occurrence in EBA cemetary close to L, Constance, this is actually a group of closely related copper types most likely originating from the exploitation of similar ore deposits in the Alps, the German Ore Mountains as well as the Carpathians by the use of a comparable smelting technique'

- bio-alkylation of metals to make alkylmetals and metallloids increases mobility and toxicity, and  ergo, genomic impact.  For example, hydrides and alkylated species are more volatile (Dopp et al. 2004, Meyer et al 2007).  
- Alkylated metal forms are more soluble in lipids, increasing bio-availability and thus toxicity.
